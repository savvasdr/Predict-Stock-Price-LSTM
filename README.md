# Predict Stock Price using LSTM

## Only for educational purposes

The goal is to be able to predict the future price of a currency/share using Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, having the history of Euro and Dollar exchange rates, we will build an LSTM  Neural Network which will predict the price of the next day.

Practically we have a timeseries and we want to predict the next step. Time series predictive problems are a difficult type of predictive modeling problem. Unlike regression predictive modeling, the time series also adds the complexity of a sequence dependence among the input variables.

A powerful type of neural network designed to handle sequence dependence is called recurrent neural networks. The Long Short-Term Memory network or LSTM network is a type of recurrent neural network used in deep learning because very large architectures can be successfully trained.
